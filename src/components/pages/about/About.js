                The Johari Window was invented by Joseph Luft and Harrington
                Ingham in the 1950s as a model for mapping personality
                awareness. By describing yourself from a fixed list of
                adjectives, then asking your friends and colleagues to describe
                you from the same list, a grid of overlap and difference can be
                built up.
