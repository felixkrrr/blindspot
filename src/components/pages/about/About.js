                The Johari Window was invented by Joseph Luft and Harrington
                Ingham in the 1950s as a model for mapping personality
                awareness. By describing yourself from a fixed list of
                adjectives, then asking your friends and colleagues to describe
                you from the same list, a grid of overlap and difference can be
                built up.

                      Open characteristics are selected by both, the subject and
                      peers. These are traits that subject and peers perceive.

                      Blind characteristics are not selected by subjects, but
                      only by their peers. These represent what others perceive
                      but the subject does not.

                      either unaware of, or that are untrue but for the
                      subjectâ€™s claim.
